# VHA-UX-Guide

User Experience Guide for VHA Systems

The User Experience Guide for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Systems helps VHA project teams create easy-to-use health information technology (HIT) systems by focusing on users and their needs.

<strong> Project Goal </strong>

This repository will house content for the UX Guide created by partners through the editorial process prior to final approval by VA.

This repository is used to store documents and files created and used by teams contributing to the UX Guide. It is also used for issue tracking and version control across the platform and teams building on UX Guide.

 <strong> Workflow for Uploading Draft Content </strong>

Start with the "Teams" Folder, select your team, and then select your "Project". Add the new content to the "Draft" folder. All editing will take place in the Draft folders (See UXG File Naming Conventions). Once finalized the files will be more to the "Final-To Be Approved" folder for HFE review. Once approved by HFE, the files will be promoted to the UXG Struture Folders. 
 
 <strong> UXG File Naming Conventions </strong>
 
 File name = content-type_Page Title_version-number (status)

Version

•	v1 = first version, before any external review or user feedback

•	v2 = second version, incorporating feedback from subject matter experts (SME) or users, or reflecting any changes after v1 has gone for review or been finalized.

•	v3 = third version, reflecting any changes after v2 has gone for review or been finalized.

With each revision within a version — including edits from SMEs, edits addressing feedback from end users, or other edits — the file number goes up one. For example: 

•	v1-01

•	v1-02

•	v1-03

Status

A file can be:

•	In progress = we are writing or editing the content

•	Ready for review = file is ready for SME review

•	Approved = content has been approved by HFE team

Examples:

•	case-study_Formative Usability Tests for Design Solution_v1-01 (in progress)

•	video-script_Common Usability Issues for Clinical Reminders_v2-02 (approved)
